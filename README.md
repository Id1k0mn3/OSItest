Hi, its my builder for FE dev. This is a first version of my builder. For this i used GULP, and webpack(only for js and modules) 

So, now such functions were added:
  1. SASS - with compiling from sass to css, i added 2 versions of style.css. 
    The first version with tabs, spaces and etc(i did it for checking styles)
    The second version is the style.min.css

  2. Nunjucks - template engine, for using cycles and for breaking apart and for other functions
  
  3. Added tasks for images, i added contraction for images and optimization, add webp type
  
  4. Local server
  
  5. Modules were Added for js with webpack
  
  6. Compiling fonts from ttf to woff2. Add function after adding fonts to folder fonts you receive a sass file with styles for font.
